I started this challenge about a week late. So I'm really just doing it to improve my skills at this point!

I'm not super good at coding, a lot of my code is inefficient and I want to get better.  
Every time I submit a solution, I compare it to a more efficent version and try to note what is the differences between mines and their. 

I am in my first semester of my sophmore year of my CompSci degree. I am learning a lot everyday. 

I am by no means a master at coding and computing. But I am trying. 

I hope anyone looking at this will keep that in mind.
