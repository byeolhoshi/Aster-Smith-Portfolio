Lovesick like a dog with canine sensitivity
Developing this new theory of relativity
Connecting our souls resting in captivity
Positive life sacrifice what it is to me
Our history, only a quarter of a century
Reality, sitting on the shoulders of our chemistry
See ain't no mystery, the colors that we mix will set the mind free
Let the blind see beyond harmony!
Breathe life into dead space blow away your clouds of doubt
New territory we determine to be
Everything a safe haven it's supposed to be
Now it might seem distant but the time is near
